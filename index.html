        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>So, here's a little bit about me. I grew up all over the US and a few places outside as well. I became interested in coding as a kid, but quickly switched to the hardware side and networking side of things instead. I'm currently taking this class to update my skillset and challenge myself</p>
